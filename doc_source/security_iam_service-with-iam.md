Before you use IAM to manage access to Lambda, you should understand what IAM features are available to use with Lambda\. To get a high\-level view of how Lambda and other AWS services work with IAM, see [AWS services that work with IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

For an overview of permissions, policies, and roles as they are used by Lambda, see [Lambda permissions](lambda-permissions.md)\.
