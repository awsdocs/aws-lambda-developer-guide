# Using AWS Lambda with Amazon SQS<a name="with-sqs"></a>

You can use an AWS Lambda function to process messages in an Amazon Simple Queue Service \(Amazon SQS\) queue\. The Lambda service [event source mappings](invocation-eventsourcemapping.md) support [standard queues](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/standard-queues.html) and [first\-in, first\-out \(FIFO\) queues](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/fifo-queues.html)\. With Amazon SQS, you can offload tasks from one component of your application by sending them to a queue and processing them asynchronously\.

The Lambda service polls the queue and invokes your function [synchronously](invocation-sync.md) with an event that contains queue messages\. The Lambda service reads messages in batches and invokes your function once for each batch\. When your function successfully processes a batch, the Lambda service deletes its messages from the queue\. The following example shows an event for a batch of two messages\.

**Example Amazon SQS message event \(standard queue\)**  

```
{
    "Records": [
        {
            "messageId": "059f36b4-87a3-44ab-83d2-661975830a7d",
            "receiptHandle": "AQEBwJnKyrHigUMZj6rYigCgxlaS3SLy0a...",
            "body": "Test message.",
            "attributes": {
                "ApproximateReceiveCount": "1",
                "SentTimestamp": "1545082649183",
                "SenderId": "AIDAIENQZJOLO23YVJ4VO",
                "ApproximateFirstReceiveTimestamp": "1545082649185"
            },
            "messageAttributes": {},
            "md5OfBody": "e4e68fb7bd0e697a0ae8f1bb342846b3",
            "eventSource": "aws:sqs",
            "eventSourceARN": "arn:aws:sqs:us-east-2:123456789012:my-queue",
            "awsRegion": "us-east-2"
        },
        {
            "messageId": "2e1424d4-f796-459a-8184-9c92662be6da",
            "receiptHandle": "AQEBzWwaftRI0KuVm4tP+/7q1rGgNqicHq...",
            "body": "Test message.",
            "attributes": {
                "ApproximateReceiveCount": "1",
                "SentTimestamp": "1545082650636",
                "SenderId": "AIDAIENQZJOLO23YVJ4VO",
                "ApproximateFirstReceiveTimestamp": "1545082650649"
            },
            "messageAttributes": {},
            "md5OfBody": "e4e68fb7bd0e697a0ae8f1bb342846b3",
            "eventSource": "aws:sqs",
            "eventSourceARN": "arn:aws:sqs:us-east-2:123456789012:my-queue",
            "awsRegion": "us-east-2"
        }
    ]
}
```

For FIFO queues, records contain additional attributes that are related to deduplication and sequencing\.

**Example Amazon SQS message event \(FIFO queue\)**  

```
{
    "Records": [
        {
            "messageId": "11d6ee51-4cc7-4302-9e22-7cd8afdaadf5",
            "receiptHandle": "AQEBBX8nesZEXmkhsmZeyIE8iQAMig7qw...",
            "body": "Test message.",
            "attributes": {
                "ApproximateReceiveCount": "1",
                "SentTimestamp": "1573251510774",
                "SequenceNumber": "18849496460467696128",
                "MessageGroupId": "1",
                "SenderId": "AIDAIO23YVJENQZJOL4VO",
                "MessageDeduplicationId": "1",
                "ApproximateFirstReceiveTimestamp": "1573251510774"
            },
            "messageAttributes": {},
            "md5OfBody": "e4e68fb7bd0e697a0ae8f1bb342846b3",
            "eventSource": "aws:sqs",
            "eventSourceARN": "arn:aws:sqs:us-east-2:123456789012:fifo.fifo",
            "awsRegion": "us-east-2"
        }
    ]
}
```

When the Lambda service reads a batch, the messages stay in the queue but become hidden for the length of the queue's [visibility timeout](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html)\. If your function successfully processes the batch, the Lambda service deletes the messages from the queue\. If your function is [throttled](invocation-scaling.md), returns an error, or doesn't respond, the message becomes visible again\. All messages in a failed batch return to the queue, so your function code must be able to process the same message multiple times without side effects\.

## Scaling and processing<a name="events-sqs-scaling"></a>

For standard queues, the Lambda service uses [long polling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-long-polling.html) to poll a queue until it becomes active\. When messages are available, the Lambda service reads up to 5 batches and sends them to your function\. If messages are still available, the Lambda service increases the number of processes that are reading batches by up to 60 more instances per minute\. The maximum number of batches that can be processed simultaneously by an event source mapping is 1000\.

For FIFO queues, the Lambda service sends messages to your function in the order that it receives them\. When you send a message to a FIFO queue, you specify a [message group ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/using-messagegroupid-property.html)\. Amazon SQS ensures that messages in the same group are delivered to the Lambda service in order\. the Lambda service sorts the messages into groups and sends only one batch at a time for a group\. If the function returns an error, all retries are attempted on the affected messages before the Lambda service receives additional messages from the same group\.

Your function can scale in concurrency to the number of active message groups\. For more information, see [SQS FIFO as an event source](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/new-for-aws-lambda-sqs-fifo-as-an-event-source/) on the AWS Compute Blog\.

## Configuring a queue for use with the Lambda service<a name="events-sqs-queueconfig"></a>

[Create an SQS queue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/) to serve as an event source for your the Lambda service function\. Then configure the queue to allow time for your the Lambda service function to process each batch of events—and for the Lambda service to retry in response to throttling errors as it scales up\.

To allow your function time to process each batch of records, set the source queue's visibility timeout to at least 6 times the [timeout](configuration-console.md) that you configure on your function\. The extra time allows for the Lambda service to retry if your function execution is throttled while your function is processing a previous batch\.

If a message fails to be processed multiple times, Amazon SQS can send it to a [dead\-letter queue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-dead-letter-queues.html)\. When your function returns an error, the Lambda service leaves it in the queue\. After the visibility timeout occurs, the Lambda service receives the message again\. To send messages to a second queue after a number of receives, configure a dead\-letter queue on your source queue\.

**Note**  
Make sure that you configure the dead\-letter queue on the source queue, not on the Lambda service function\. The dead\-letter queue that you configure on a function is used for the function's [asynchronous invocation queue](invocation-async.md), not for event source queues\.

If your function returns an error, or can't be invoked because it's at maximum concurrency, processing might succeed with additional attempts\. To give messages a better chance to be processed before sending them to the dead\-letter queue, set the `maxReceiveCount` on the source queue's redrive policy to at least **5**\.

## Execution role permissions<a name="events-sqs-permissions"></a>

the Lambda service needs the following permissions to manage messages in your Amazon SQS queue\. Add them to your function's execution role\.
+ [sqs:ReceiveMessage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_ReceiveMessage.html)
+ [sqs:DeleteMessage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteMessage.html)
+ [sqs:GetQueueAttributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_GetQueueAttributes.html)

For more information, see [AWS the Lambda service execution role](lambda-intro-execution-role.md)\.

## Configuring a queue as an event source<a name="events-sqs-eventsource"></a>

Create an event source mapping to tell the Lambda service to send items from your queue to a the Lambda service function\. You can create multiple event source mappings to process items from multiple queues with a single function\. When the Lambda service invokes the target function, the event can contain multiple items, up to a configurable maximum *batch size*\.

To configure your function to read from Amazon SQS in the Lambda service console, create an **SQS** trigger\.

**To create a trigger**

1. Open the Lambda service console [Functions page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home#/functions)\.

1. Choose a function\.

1. Under **Designer**, choose **Add trigger**\.

1. Choose a trigger type\.

1. Configure the required options and then choose **Add**\.

the Lambda service supports the following options for Amazon SQS event sources\.

**Event source options**
+ **SQS queue** – The Amazon SQS queue to read records from\.
+ **Batch size** – The number of items to read from the queue in each batch, up to 10\. The event might contain fewer items if the batch that the Lambda service read from the queue had fewer items\.
+ **Enabled** – Set to true to enable the event source mapping\. Set to false to stop processing records\.

**Note**  
Amazon SQS has a perpetual free tier for requests\. Beyond the free tier, Amazon SQS charges per million requests\. While your event source mapping is active, the Lambda service makes requests to the queue to get items\. For pricing details, see [Amazon Simple Queue Service pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/pricing)\.

To manage the event source configuration later, choose the trigger in the designer\.

Configure your function timeout to allow enough time to process an entire batch of items\. If items take a long time to process, choose a smaller batch size\. A large batch size can improve efficiency for workloads that are very fast or have a lot of overhead\. However, if your function returns an error, all items in the batch return to the queue\. If you configure [reserved concurrency](configuration-concurrency.md) on your function, set a minimum of 5 concurrent executions to reduce the chance of throttling errors when the Lambda service invokes your function\.

## Event source mapping APIs<a name="services-dynamodb-api"></a>

To manage event source mappings with the AWS CLI or AWS SDK, use the following API actions:
+ [CreateEventSourceMapping](API_CreateEventSourceMapping.md)
+ [ListEventSourceMappings](API_ListEventSourceMappings.md)
+ [GetEventSourceMapping](API_GetEventSourceMapping.md)
+ [UpdateEventSourceMapping](API_UpdateEventSourceMapping.md)
+ [DeleteEventSourceMapping](API_DeleteEventSourceMapping.md)

The following example uses the AWS CLI to map a function named `my-function` to an Amazon SQS queue that is specified by its Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\), with a batch size of 5\.

```
$ aws lambda create-event-source-mapping --function-name my-function --batch-size 5 \
--event-source-arn arn:aws:sqs:us-east-2:123456789012:my-queue
{
    "UUID": "2b733gdc-8ac3-cdf5-af3a-1827b3b11284",
    "BatchSize": 5,
    "EventSourceArn": "arn:aws:sqs:us-east-2:123456789012:my-queue",
    "FunctionArn": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-2:123456789012:function:my-function",
    "LastModified": 1541139209.351,
    "State": "Creating",
    "StateTransitionReason": "USER_INITIATED"
}
```
