# Configuring interface VPC endpoints for Lambda<a name="configuration-vpc-endpoints"></a>

If you use Amazon Virtual Private Cloud \(Amazon VPC\) to host your AWS resources, you can establish a connection between your VPC and Lambda\. You can use this connection to invoke your Lambda function without crossing the public internet\.

To establish a private connection between your VPC and Lambda, create an [interface VPC endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpce-interface.html)\. Interface endpoints are powered by [AWS PrivateLink](http://aws.amazon.com/privatelink), which enables you to privately access Lambda APIs without an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection\. Instances in your VPC don't need public IP addresses to communicate with Lambda APIs\. Traffic between your VPC and Lambda does not leave the AWS network\.

Each interface endpoint is represented by one or more [elastic network interfaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html) in your subnets\. A network interface provides a private IP address that serves as an entry point for traffic to Lambda\.

## Considerations for Lambda interface endpoints<a name="vpc-endpoint-considerations"></a>

Before you set up an interface endpoint for Lambda, be sure to review [Interface endpoint properties and limitations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpce-interface.html#vpce-interface-limitations) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.

You can call any of the Lambda API operations from your VPC\. For example, you can invoke the Lambda function by calling the `Invoke` API from within your VPC\. For the full list of Lambda APIs, see [Actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_Operations.html) in the Lambda API reference\.

### Keep\-alive for persistent connections<a name="vpc-endpoint-considerations-keepalive"></a>

Lambda purges idle connections over time, so you must use a keep\-alive directive to maintain persistent connections\. Attempting to reuse an idle connection when invoking a function results in a connection error\. To maintain your persistent connection, use the keep\-alive directive associated with your runtime\. For an example, see [Reusing Connections with Keep\-Alive in Node\.js](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/node-reusing-connections.html) in the *AWS SDK for JavaScript Developer Guide*\.

### Billing Considerations<a name="vpc-endpoint-considerations-billing"></a>

There is no additional cost to access a Lambda function through an interface endpoint\. For more Lambda pricing information, see [AWS Lambda Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/)\.

Standard pricing for AWS PrivateLink applies to interface endpoints for Lambda\. Your AWS account is billed for every hour an interface endpoint is provisioned in each Availability Zone and for data processed through the interface endpoint\. For more interface endpoint pricing information, see [AWS PrivateLink pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/pricing/)\.

### VPC Peering Considerations<a name="vpc-endpoint-considerations-peering"></a>

You can connect other VPCs to the VPC with interface endpoints using [VPC peering](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/what-is-vpc-peering.html)\. VPC peering is a networking connection between two VPCs\. You can establish a VPC peering connection between your own two VPCs, or with a VPC in another AWS account\. The VPCs can also be in two different AWS Regions\.

Traffic between peered VPCs stays on the AWS network and does not traverse the public internet\. Once VPCs are peered, resources like Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) instances, Amazon Relational Database Service \(Amazon RDS\) instances, or VPC\-enabled Lambda functions in both VPCs can access the Lambda API through interface endpoints created in the one of the VPCs\.

## Creating an interface endpoint for Lambda<a name="vpc-endpoint-create"></a>

You can create an interface endpoint for Lambda using either the Amazon VPC console or the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\)\. For more information, see [Creating an interface endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpce-interface.html#create-interface-endpoint) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.

**To create an interface endpoint for Lambda \(console\)**

1. Open the [Endpoints page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home?#Endpoints) of the Amazon VPC console\.

1. Choose **Create Endpoint**\.

1. For **Service category**, verify that **AWS services** is selected\.

1. For **Service Name**, choose **com\.amazonaws\.*region*\.lambda**\. Verify that the **Type** is **Interface**\.

1. Choose a VPC and subnets\.

1. To enable private DNS for the interface endpoint, select the **Enable DNS Name** check box\.

1. For **Security group**, choose one or more security groups\.

1. Choose **Create endpoint**\.

To use the private DNS option, you must set the `enableDnsHostnames` and `enableDnsSupportattributes` of your VPC\. For more information, see [Viewing and updating DNS support for your VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-dns.html#vpc-dns-updating) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\. If you enable private DNS for the interface endpoint, you can make API requests to Lambda using its default DNS name for the Region, for example, `lambda.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`\. For more service endpoints, see [Service endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-service-information.html) in the *AWS General Reference*\.

For more information, see [Accessing a service through an interface endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpce-interface.html#access-service-though-endpoint) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.

For information about creating and configuring an endpoint using AWS CloudFormation, see the [AWS::EC2::VPCEndpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-ec2-vpcendpoint.html) resource in the *AWS CloudFormation User Guide*\.

**To create an interface endpoint for Lambda \(AWS CLI\)**  
Use the `create-vpc-endpoint` command and specify the VPC ID, VPC endpoint type \(interface\), service name, subnets that will use the endpoint, and security groups to associate with the endpoint's network interfaces\. For example:

```
aws ec2 create-vpc-endpoint --vpc-id vpc-ec43eb89 --vpc-endpoint-type Interface --service-name \
   com.amazonaws.us-east-1.lambda --subnet-id subnet-abababab --security-group-id sg-1a2b3c4d
```

## Creating an interface endpoint policy for Lambda<a name="vpc-endpoint-policy"></a>

To control who can use your interface endpoint and which Lambda functions the user can access, you can attach an endpoint policy to your endpoint\. The policy specifies the following information:
+ The principal that can perform actions\.
+ The actions that the principal can perform\.
+ The resources on which the principal can perform actions\.

For more information, see [Controlling access to services with VPC endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints-access.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.

**Example: Interface endpoint policy for Lambda actions**  
The following is an example of an endpoint policy for Lambda\. When attached to an endpoint, this policy allows user `MyUser` to invoke the function `my-function`\.

**Note**  
You need to include both the qualified and the unqualified function ARN in the resource\.

```
{
   "Statement":[
      {
         "Principal":
         { 
             "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/MyUser" 
         },
         "Effect":"Allow",
         "Action":[
            "lambda:InvokeFunction"
         ],
         "Resource": [
               "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-2:123456789012:function:my-function",
               "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-2:123456789012:function:my-function:*"
            ]
      }
   ]
}
```
