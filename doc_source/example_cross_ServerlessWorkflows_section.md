#### [ Java ]

**SDK for Java 2\.x**  
 Shows how to create an AWS serverless workflow by using AWS Step Functions and the AWS SDK for Java 2\.x\. Each workflow step is implemented using an AWS Lambda function\.   
 For complete source code and instructions on how to set up and run, see the full example on [GitHub](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/javav2/usecases/creating_workflows_stepfunctions)\.   

**Services used in this example**
+ DynamoDB
+ Lambda
+ Amazon SES
+ Step Functions

#### [ JavaScript ]

**SDK for JavaScript V3**  
 Shows how to create an AWS serverless workflow by using AWS Step Functions and the AWS SDK for JavaScript\. Each workflow step is implemented using an AWS Lambda function\.   
Lambda is a compute service that enables you to run code without provisioning or managing servers\. Step Functions is a serverless orchestration service that lets you combine Lambda functions and other AWS services to build business\-critical applications\.   
 For complete source code and instructions on how to set up and run, see the full example on [GitHub](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/javascriptv3/example_code/cross-services/lambda-step-functions)\.   
This example is also available in the [AWS SDK for JavaScript v3 developer guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/serverless-step-functions-example.html)\.  

**Services used in this example**
+ DynamoDB
+ Lambda
+ Amazon SES
+ Step Functions
