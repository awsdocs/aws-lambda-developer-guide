# Building Lambda functions with Go<a name="lambda-golang"></a>

The following sections explain how common programming patterns and core concepts apply when authoring Lambda function code in [Go](https://golang.org/)\.


**Go**  

| Name | Identifier | Operating system | Architectures | Deprecation | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
|  Go 1\.x  |  `go1.x`  |  Amazon Linux  |  x86\_64  |    | 

**Note**  
Runtimes that use the Amazon Linux operating system, such as Go 1\.x, do not support the arm64 architecture\. To use arm64 architecture, you can run Go with the provided\.al2 runtime\.

Lambda provides the following tools and libraries for the Go runtime:

**Tools and libraries for Go**
+ [AWS SDK for Go](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go): the official AWS SDK for the Go programming language\.
+ [github\.com/aws/aws\-lambda\-go/lambda](https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/tree/master/lambda): The implementation of the Lambda programming model for Go\. This package is used by AWS Lambda to invoke your [handler](golang-handler.md)\.
+ [github\.com/aws/aws\-lambda\-go/lambdacontext](https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/tree/master/lambdacontext): Helpers for accessing context information from the [context object](golang-context.md)\.
+ [github\.com/aws/aws\-lambda\-go/events](https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/tree/master/events): This library provides type definitions for common event source integrations\.
+ [github\.com/aws/aws\-lambda\-go/cmd/build\-lambda\-zip](https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/tree/master/cmd/build-lambda-zip): This tool can be used to create a \.zip file archive on Windows\.

Lambda provides the following sample applications for the Go runtime:
