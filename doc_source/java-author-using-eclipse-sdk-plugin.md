# Authoring Lambda Functions Using Eclipse IDE and AWS SDK Plugin \(Java\)<a name="java-author-using-eclipse-sdk-plugin"></a>

AWS SDK Eclipse Toolkit provides an Eclipse plugin for you to both create a deployment package and also upload it to create a Lambda function\. If you can use Eclipse IDE as your development environment, this plugin enables you to author Java code, create and upload a deployment package, and create your Lambda function\. For more information, see the [AWS Toolkit for Eclipse Getting Started Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSToolkitEclipse/latest/GettingStartedGuide/)\. For an example of using the toolkit for authoring Lambda functions, see [Using AWS Lambda with the AWS Toolkit for Eclipse](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSToolkitEclipse/latest/GettingStartedGuide/lambda.html)\.
