Before you get started, you must first set up a PowerShell development environment\. For instructions on how to do this, see [Setting Up a PowerShell Development Environment](powershell-devenv.md)\.

To learn about how to use the AWSLambdaPSCore module to download sample PowerShell projects from templates, create PowerShell deployment packages, and deploy PowerShell functions to the AWS Cloud, see [Deploy PowerShell Lambda functions with \.zip file archives](powershell-package.md)\.
