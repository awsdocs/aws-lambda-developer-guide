When you increase the number of concurrent batches per shard, your function's concurrency can be up to 10 times the number of shards in your stream\. For details, see [Lambda event source mapping](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-eventsourcemapping.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss)\. | November 25, 2019 | 
| [Function states](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/functions-states.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss) | When you create or update a function, it enters a pending state while Lambda provisions resources to support it\. If you connect your function to a VPC, Lambda can create a shared elastic network interface right away, instead of creating network interfaces when your function is invoked\. This results in better performance for VPC\-connected functions, but might require an update to your automation\. For details, see [AWS Lambda function states](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/functions-states.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss)\. | November 25, 2019 |

For instructions, see [Creating an application with continuous delivery in the Lambda console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/applications-tutorial.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss)\. | October 3, 2019 | 
| [Performance improvements for VPC\-connected functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-vpc.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss) | Lambda now uses a new type of elastic network interface that is shared by all functions in a virtual private cloud \(VPC\) subnet\. When you connect a function to a VPC, Lambda creates a network interface for each combination of security group and subnet that you choose\. When the shared network interfaces are available, the function no longer needs to create additional network interfaces as it scales up\. This dramatically improves startup times\. For details, see [Configuring a Lambda function to access resources in a VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-vpc.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss)\. | September 3, 2019 | 
| [Stream batch settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-ddb.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss) | You can now configure a batch window for [Amazon DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-ddb.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss) and [Amazon Kinesis](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-kinesis.html?icmpid=docs_lambda_rss) event source mappings\. Configure a batch window of up to five minutes to buffer incoming records until a full batch is available\. This reduces the number of times that your function is invoked when the stream is less active\. | August 29, 2019 |
