# Create a Simple Lambda Function and Explore the Console<a name="getting-started-create-function"></a>

In this Getting Started exercise you first create a Lambda function using the AWS Lambda console\. Next, you manually invoke the Lambda function using sample event data\. AWS Lambda executes the Lambda function and returns results\. You then verify execution results, including the logs that your Lambda function created and various CloudWatch metrics\. 

As you follow the steps, you will also familiarize yourself with the AWS Lambda console including:
+ Explore the blueprints\. Each blueprint provides sample code and sample configurations that enable you to create Lambda functions with just a few clicks\. 
+ View and update configuration information of your Lambda function\.
+ Invoke a Lambda function manually and explore results in the **Execution results** section\.
+ Monitor CloudWatch metrics in the console\.
