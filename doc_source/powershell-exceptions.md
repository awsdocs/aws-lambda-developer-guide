# Function Errors \(PowerShell\)<a name="powershell-exceptions"></a>

If your Lambda function has a terminating error, AWS Lambda recognizes the failure, serializes the error information into JSON, and returns it\.

Consider the following PowerShell script example statement:

```
throw 'The Account is not found'
```

When you invoke this Lambda function, it throws a terminating error, and AWS Lambda returns the following error message:

```
{
  "errorMessage": "The Account is not found",
  "errorType": "RuntimeException"
}
```

Note the `errorType` is `RuntimeException`, which is the default exception thrown by PowerShell\. You can use custom error types by throwing the error like this:

```
throw @{'Exception'='AccountNotFound';'Message'='The Account is not found'}
```

The error message is serialized with `errorType` set to `AccountNotFound`:

```
{
  "errorMessage": "The Account is not found",
  "errorType": "AccountNotFound"
}
```

If you don't need an error message, you can throw a string in the format of an error code\. The error code format requires that the string starts with a character and only contain letters and digits afterwards, with no spaces or symbols\.

For example, if your Lambda function contains the following:

```
throw 'AccountNotFound'
```

The error is serialized like this:

```
{
  "errorMessage": "AccountNotFound",
  "errorType": "AccountNotFound"
}
```

## Function Error Handling<a name="powershell-custom-errors"></a>

You can use a custom errorType in your Lambda function and handle function errors directly \(Retry or Catch\) within an AWS Step Functions State Machine\. For more information, see [Handling Error Conditions Using a State Machine](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/tutorial-handling-error-conditions.html)\. 

Custom error handling makes it easier to create [serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless) applications\. This feature integrates with all the languages that are supported by the Lambda [Programming Model](programming-model-v2.md)\. This allows you to design your application in the programming languages of your choice, mixing and matching as you go\.
