You can send requests to your Lambda function endpoint URL\. You can configure security on the endpoint to allow open access, leverage AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) to authorize access, or use API keys to meter access to your Lambda functions by others\.  For an example Getting Started exercise, see  [Using AWS Lambda with Amazon API Gateway](with-on-demand-https.md)\.  For more information about the Amazon API Gateway, see [https://aws\.amazon\.com/api\-gateway/](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/)\.   | July 09, 2015 |

|  AWS Lambda now supports Java to author your Lambda functions\.   |  You can now author Lambda code in Java\. For more information, see  [Programming Model](programming-model-v2.md)\.  | June 15, 2015 | 
|  AWS Lambda now supports specifying an Amazon S3 object as the function \.zip when creating or updating a Lambda function\.   |  You can upload a Lambda function deployment package \(\.zip file\) to an Amazon S3 bucket in the same region where you want to create a Lambda function\. Then, you can specify the bucket name and object key name when you create or update a Lambda function\.  | May 28, 2015 |
