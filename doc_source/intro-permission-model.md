# AWS Lambda Permissions Model<a name="intro-permission-model"></a>

For the end\-to\-end AWS Lambda\-based applications to work, you have to manage various permissions\. For example:
+ For event sources, except for the stream\-based services \(Amazon Kinesis Data Streams and DynamoDB\) or Amazon SQS queues, you must grant the event source permissions to invoke your AWS Lambda function\. 
+ For poll\-based event sources \(Amazon Kinesis Data Streams and DynamoDB streams and Amazon SQS queues\), AWS Lambda polls the resource on your behalf and reads new records\. To enable this, you need to grant AWS Lambda permissions to access the new records\. In turn, AWS Lambda will invoke any Lambda function subscribed to this event source to process the event\.
+ For any other event source that will invoke your Lambda function directly, you must grant that event source permissions to invoke your AWS Lambda function\. 

The following sections describe permissions management\.

## Manage Permissions: Using an IAM Role \(Execution Role\)<a name="lambda-intro-execution-role"></a>

Each Lambda function has an IAM role \(execution role\) associated with it\. You specify the IAM role when you create your Lambda function\. Permissions you grant to this role determine what AWS Lambda can do when it assumes the role\. There are two types of permissions that you grant to the IAM role:
+ If your Lambda function code accesses other AWS resources, such as reading an object from an S3 bucket or writing logs to CloudWatch Logs, you need to grant permissions for relevant Amazon S3 and CloudWatch actions to the role\.

   
+ If the event source is poll\-based \(Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, DynamoDB, Amazon SQS\), AWS Lambda polls these resources on your behalf\. AWS Lambda needs permissions to poll either the stream or queue to read new records\. To enable this, you need to grant AWS Lambda permissions to access the new records\. In turn, AWS Lambda will invoke any Lambda function subscribed to this event source to process the event\. 

For more information about IAM roles, see [Roles \(Delegation and Federation\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\. 

**Important**  
The user that creates the IAM role is, in effect, passing permissions to AWS Lambda to assume this role\. This requires the user to have permissions for the `iam:PassRole` action\. If you are a user with administrator priviledges creating this role, you don't need to do anything extra to set up permissions for the `iam:PassRole` action because the administrator user has full permissions, including the `iam:PassRole` action\.

To simplify the process for creating an execution role, AWS Lambda provides the following AWS managed \(predefined\) permissions policies that you can use\. These policies include common permissions for specific scenarios:
+ **AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole** – Grants permissions only for the Amazon CloudWatch Logs actions to write logs\. You can use this policy if your Lambda function does not access any other AWS resources except writing logs\. 

   
+ **AWSLambdaKinesisExecutionRole** – Grants permissions for Amazon Kinesis Data Streams actions, and CloudWatch Logs actions\. If you are writing a Lambda function to process Kinesis stream events you can attach this permissions policy\.

   
+ **AWSLambdaDynamoDBExecutionRole** – Grants permissions for DynamoDB streams actions and CloudWatch Logs actions\. If you are writing a Lambda function to process DynamoDB stream events you can attach this permissions policy\.

   
+ **AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole** – Grants permissions for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) actions to manage elastic network interfaces \(ENIs\)\. If you are writing a Lambda function to access resources in a VPC in the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud \(Amazon VPC\) service, you can attach this permissions policy\. The policy also grants permissions for CloudWatch Logs actions to write logs\.

  You can find these AWS managed permissions policies in the IAM console\. Search for these policies and you can see the permissions each of these policies grant\.

## Manage Permissions: Using a Lambda Function Policy<a name="intro-permission-model-access-policy"></a>

All supported event sources, except the poll\-based sources that are stream\-based \(Kinesis and DynamoDB\) or messaged\-based \(Amazon SQS\), invoke your Lambda function using the *push model*, provided that you grant the necessary permissions\. For example, if you want Amazon S3 to invoke your Lambda function when objects are created in a bucket, Amazon S3 needs permissions to invoke your Lambda function\. 

You grant these permissions via function policies\. \(For a sample list, see [Policy Templates](policy-templates.md)\.\) AWS Lambda provides APIs for you to manage permission in a function policy\. For example, see [AddPermission](API_AddPermission.md)\.

You can also grant cross\-account permissions using the function policy\. For example, if a user\-defined application and the Lambda function it invokes belong to the same AWS account, you don't need to grant explicit permissions\. Otherwise, the AWS account that owns the Lambda function must allow cross\-account permissions in the permissions policy associated with the Lambda function\.

Instead of using a Lambda function policy, you can create another IAM role that grants the event sources \(for example, Amazon S3 or DynamoDB\) permissions to invoke your Lambda function\. However, you might find that resource policies are easier to set up and make it easier for you to track which event sources have permissions to invoke your Lambda function\.
