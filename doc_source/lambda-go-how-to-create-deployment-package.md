# AWS Lambda Deployment Package in Go<a name="lambda-go-how-to-create-deployment-package"></a>

To create a Lambda function you first create a Lambda function deployment package, a \.zip file consisting of your code \(a Go executable\) and any dependencies\.

After you create a deployment package, you may either upload it directly or upload the \.zip file first to an Amazon S3 bucket in the same AWS region where you want to create the Lambda function, and then specify the bucket name and object key name when you create the Lambda function using the console or the AWS CLI\.

Download the Lambda library for Go with `go get`, and compile your executable\.

```
~/my-function$ go get github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/lambda
~/my-function$ GOOS=linux go build main.go
```

Setting `GOOS` to `linux` ensures that the compiled executable is compatible with the [Go runtime](lambda-runtimes.md), even if you compile it in a non\-Linux environment\.

Create a deployment package by packaging the executable in a ZIP file, and use the AWS CLI to create a function\. The handler parameter must match the name of the executable containing your handler\.

```
~/my-function$ zip function.zip main
~/my-function$ aws lambda create-function --function-name my-function --runtime go1.x \
  --zip-file fileb://function.zip --handler main \
  --role arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/execution_role
```

## Creating a Deployment Package on Windows<a name="lambda-go-how-to-create-deployment-package-windows"></a>

To create a \.zip that will work on AWS Lambda using Windows, we recommend installing the **build\-lambda\-zip** tool\.

**Note**  
If you have not already done so, you will need to install [git](https://git-scm.com/) and then add the `git` executable to your Windows `%PATH%` environment variable\.

To download the tool, run the following command:

```
go.exe get -u github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/cmd/build-lambda-zip
```

Use the tool from your `GOPATH`\. If you have a default installation of Go, the tool will typically be in `%USERPROFILE%\Go\bin`\. Otherwise, navigate to where you installed the Go runtime and do the following:

In cmd\.exe, run the following:

```
set GOOS=linux
go build -o main main.go
%USERPROFILE%\Go\bin\build-lambda-zip.exe --output main.zip main
```

In Powershell, run the following:

```
$env:GOOS = "linux"
go build -o main main.go
~\Go\Bin\build-lambda-zip.exe --output main.zip main
```
