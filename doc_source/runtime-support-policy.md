# Runtime Support Policy<a name="runtime-support-policy"></a>

AWS Lambda will only deprecate runtime versions that are marked as EOL \(End of Life\) at the end of their maintenance window\. You will no longer be able to create new functions in the deprecated runtime. Existing functions that use the deprecated runtime will only allow one update option, that is, to use a supported runtime version instead\. AWS Lambda will not provide security updates, technical support or hotfixes for deprecated runtimes and reserves the right to disable invocation of functions that run on a deprecated runtime at any time\. You can find a list of deprecated runtime versions below:


| Runtime | Version | 
| --- | --- | 
| Node\.js |  0\.10  |
