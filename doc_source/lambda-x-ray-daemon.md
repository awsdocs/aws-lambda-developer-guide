# The AWS X\-Ray Daemon in the Lambda Environment<a name="lambda-x-ray-daemon"></a>

[The AWS X\-Ray Daemon](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-daemon.html) is a software application that gathers raw segment data and relays it to the AWS X\-Ray service\. The daemon works in conjunction with the AWS X\-Ray SDKs so that data sent by the SDKs can reach the X\-Ray service\. 

When you trace your Lambda function, the X\-Ray daemon automatically runs in the Lambda environment to gather trace data and send it to X\-Ray\. When tracing, the X\-Ray daemon consumes a maximum of 16 MB or 3 percent of your function's memory allocation\. For example, if you allocate 128 MB of memory to your Lambda function, the X\-Ray daemon has 16 MB of your function's memory allocation\. If you allocate 1024 MB to your Lambda function, the X\-Ray daemon has 31 MB allocated to it \(3 percent\)\. For more information, see [The AWS X\-Ray Daemon](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-daemon.html)\.

**Note**  
Lambda will try to terminate the X\-Ray daemon to avoid exceeding your function's memory limit\. For example, assume you have allocated 128 MB to your Lambda function, which means the X\-Ray daemon will have 16 MB allocated to it\. That leaves your Lambda function with a memory allocation of 112 MB\. However, if your function exceeds 112 MB, the X\-Ray daemon will be terminated to avoid throwing an out\-of\-memory error\.
