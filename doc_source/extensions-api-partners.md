## AWS managed extensions<a name="aws-managed-extensions"></a>

AWS provides its own managed extensions, including:
+ [AWS AppConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/appconfig-integration-lambda-extensions.html#appconfig-integration-lambda-extensions-enabling) – Use feature flags and dynamic data to update your Lambda functions\. You can also use this extension to update other dynamic configuration, such as ops throttling and tuning\. 
+ [Amazon CodeGuru Profiler](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/profiler-ug/python-lambda-layers.html) – Improves application performance and reduces cost by pinpointing an application's most expensive line of code and providing recommendations for improving code\.
+ [CloudWatch Lambda Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Lambda-Insights.html) – Monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize the performance of your Lambda functions through automated dashboards\.
+ [AWS Distro for Open Telemetry](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/lambda) – Enables functions to send trace data to AWS monitoring services such as AWS X\-Ray, and to destinations that support OpenTelemetry such as Honeycomb and Lightstep\.
+ **AWS Parameters and Secrets** – Enables customers to securely retrieve parameters from [AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ps-integration-lambda-extensions.html) and secrets from [AWS Secrets Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/retrieving-secrets_lambda.html)\.
